# Dicecamp Clone  DevOps 101 Project

This project is a simple static website inspired by dicecamp.com, built to demonstrate a **full local DevOps workflow** using Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes (Minikube), GitHub, and CI/CD foundations.

The goal is to understand how an application moves from **local files → container → Kubernetes → version control → cloud deployment**.

---

##�� Project Overview

**What this project includes:**
- Static HTML/CSS website
- Docker image using NGINX
- Local development with Docker Compose
- Kubernetes deployment using Minikube
- Git version control
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline (build validation)
- Prepared for EC2 deployment

## ��� Website

- Pure HTML and CSS
- Served using NGINX
- Files located in `site/`

---

## ��� Docker

### Dockerfile
- Uses `nginx:alpine` as a base image
- Copies static website files into NGINX web root
- Exposes port 80

### Build image locally
```bash
docker build -t dicecamp:1.0 .

Run container locally
docker run -p 8080:80 dicecamp:1.0

Access at:
http://localhost:8080

Run with Docker Compose
docker compose up --build

Access at:
http://localhost:8080

Start Minikube
minikube start --driver=docker

Kubernetes manifests
deployment.yaml – defines the app deployment
service.yaml – exposes the app via NodePort

Deploy to Minikube
kubectl apply -f k8s/

Load Docker image into Minikube (Windows / Git Bash)
minikube image load dicecamp:1.0

Access the service
minikube service dicecamp-service

CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
Current Pipeline
Triggered on every push to main
Checks out repository
Builds Docker image to ensure project integrity
File location:
.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
